This repository is dedicated to storing and sharing code for exploring software that could be used in the [MEXCA](https://github.com/mexca) project.

## Directories
`/audio`: Audio files for exploring libraries

`pretrained_models`: Model files from HuggingFace Hub (used by SpeechBrain)

`processed`: Output files from OpenFace

`speaker_id_model`: Model and data files for training and fine-tuning a SpeechBrain speaker recognition model

`/video`: Video files for exploring libraries
